This perl script allows you to read values from 1-wire sensors connected to your raspberry pi via snmp. 
It will return a value for each 1-wire device connected to the system.

The oid to query for this information is at .1.3.6.1.4.1.41050. In the example I have a two  1-wire temperature sensors
connected to the raspberry pi, query it with snmpwalk like this: 

snmpwalk -c public -v2c localhost .1.3.6.1.4.1.41050

and the output would look like this:

iso.3.6.1.4.1.41050.0 = INTEGER: 21
iso.3.6.1.4.1.41050.1 = INTEGER: 21

In order to get this working, install NET-SNMP (with the perl extensions), put a copy of the raspmon_snmp.pl file into
/usr/share/snmp/raspmon_snmp.pl, and edit your snmp.conf file (normally /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf)
with the following line:

perl do "/usr/share/snmp/raspmon_snmp.pl"

Restart the snmpd service and and you should be good to go
